# Employee Data Analysis Power BI Dashboard

This repository contains the Power BI dashboard created as part of the final capstone project on Employee Pulse Retention Analysis and Insights. The dashboard provides visual insights into various employee metrics and performance, helping organizations make data-driven decisions related to employee satisfaction, retention, and career growth.

## Overview

The Power BI dashboard is designed to analyze employee demographics, job satisfaction, career growth, and company insights. It consists of two pages:

1. **Employee Demographics & Job Satisfaction**: Focuses on the relationship between employee demographics (age, gender, job role, etc.) and their job satisfaction levels.
2. **Career Growth & Company Insights**: Explores career progression, performance ratings, and insights on employee retention, attrition rates, and overall company health.

## Features

- **Interactive Visuals**: Dynamic charts and graphs that allow for easy exploration of employee data.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Essential metrics such as employee satisfaction, attrition rates, performance ratings, and more.
- **Data Filtering**: Ability to filter and drill down into specific demographics, job roles, or other attributes.
- **Insights on Retention**: Analysis of factors affecting employee retention and recommendations for improving retention rates.

## Data Sources

The dashboard is built using a dataset containing employee information including:

- **Demographics**: Age, gender, marital status, education level, etc.
- **Job Attributes**: Job role, department, work environment, etc.
- **Satisfaction and Performance**: Job satisfaction, performance ratings, and job involvement.
- **Attrition**: Employee turnover data and reasons for leaving.

The dataset used for this analysis was cleaned, pre-processed, and subjected to feature engineering for better insights and model accuracy.

## Power BI Dashboard Structure

### Page 1: Employee Demographics & Job Satisfaction
- **Visuals**: Bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots displaying job satisfaction trends based on employee demographics.
- **KPIs**: Average job satisfaction score, demographic breakdown, and more.

### Page 2: Career Growth & Company Insights
- **Visuals**: Line charts, heat maps, and histograms for performance ratings, career growth trajectories, and retention analysis.
- **KPIs**: Career progression insights, performance ratings distribution, employee turnover analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: For creating the dashboard and visualizations.
- **DAX**: For creating calculated columns and measures.
- **Power Query**: For data transformation and cleaning.
- **SQL**: For database queries to extract data (if applicable).

## Setup Instructions

To view or modify the Power BI dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Suryakarolly/Employee-Pulse-Retention-Analysis-and-Insights-final-capstone-project-/tree/main/powerBI%20dashboard
   ```

2. Open the `Employee_Pulse_Retention_Analysis.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.

3. The dashboard will load with pre-configured data models and visuals.

4. If you need to connect to a new dataset, ensure it follows the same structure and format as the original dataset for compatibility.

## How to Use the Dashboard

1. **Navigating Pages**: Use the tabs at the bottom of the screen to switch between the two pages: *Employee Demographics & Job Satisfaction* and *Career Growth & Company Insights*.
   
2. **Interactivity**: Click on different chart elements to filter and drill down into specific employee groups or data points.

3. **Data Filters**: Use slicers to filter the data by different attributes like age, department, or performance ratings.

## Future Improvements

- **Predictive Analytics**: Integrate machine learning models to predict employee attrition and performance trends.
- **Employee Feedback**: Incorporate sentiment analysis from employee surveys to provide more granular insights into satisfaction and engagement.
- **Real-Time Dashboards**: Connect the dashboard to a live data stream for real-time insights and updates.
