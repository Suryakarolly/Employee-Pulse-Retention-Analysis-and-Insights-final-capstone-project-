# Employee Pulse Retention Analysis and Insights

This repository contains a dataset and analysis for exploring employee retention and job satisfaction in a corporate setting. The dataset, `new_train.csv`, includes a wide range of features to help understand employee demographics, job satisfaction, performance, and other key metrics. This analysis aims to derive insights into the factors affecting employee retention and job performance, with the goal of improving organizational decision-making and employee satisfaction.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the factors influencing employee retention and identify patterns that may help the company improve employee satisfaction and reduce turnover rates. The insights gained from this analysis will be valuable for HR and management in making data-driven decisions related to employee engagement, retention, and career development.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following key components:

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and transforming features where necessary.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting a thorough EDA to explore patterns and trends in the data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that can help improve the performance of machine learning models.
- **Modeling**: Building machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict employee attrition and performance.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: A visual representation of key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights derived from the data, including employee demographics, job satisfaction, career growth opportunities, and company insights.
