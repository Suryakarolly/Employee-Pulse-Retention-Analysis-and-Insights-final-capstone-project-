# Employee Pulse Retention Analysis and Insights

This project involves analyzing employee data to gain insights into factors affecting employee retention, satisfaction, and overall performance. The analysis is based on a dataset containing various employee attributes and performance metrics, such as demographics, job roles, satisfaction, performance ratings, and attrition. The project includes data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning algorithms to build predictive models for employee retention.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to provide actionable insights to improve employee retention and satisfaction through data analysis. The analysis was performed in a Jupyter Notebook environment using Python.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Jupyter Notebook (Python)**: Contains the code for data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model building.
- **Data**: The dataset used for this analysis, including employee information such as demographics, job roles, satisfaction, performance ratings, and attrition.
- **Results**: Includes the results of the exploratory data analysis and model performance evaluation.

## Key Sections in the Notebook

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: 
   - The dataset is loaded and cleaned to handle missing values, incorrect data types, and any irrelevant features.

2. **Feature Engineering**: 
   - New features are created based on existing columns to better understand patterns in employee data.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Key statistical and visual analyses are conducted to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations in the dataset.
   - Key visualizations include bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps.

4. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Several machine learning models are applied, including:
     - Logistic Regression
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Decision Tree
     - Naive Bayes
     - Random Forest
   - The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and other relevant metrics.

5. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - The insights gained from the analysis are summarized, including factors affecting employee retention.
   - Recommendations are made based on the findings to improve employee satisfaction and reduce attrition.

## Prerequisites

To run the Jupyter notebooks, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `plotly`
- `xgboost`

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run the Notebooks

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Suryakarolly/Employee-Pulse-Retention-Analysis-and-Insights-final-capstone-project-/tree/main/Jupyter%20Notebook%20(Python)
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   cd Jupyter\ Notebook\ (Python)
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open the notebook file and run the cells to replicate the analysis.

## Results

The notebook provides insights into the factors influencing employee retention and performance. Key results include:

- The most significant predictors of employee attrition.
- Key trends in employee satisfaction based on demographic attributes.
- Performance evaluations of various machine learning models.
